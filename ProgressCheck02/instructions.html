<body><p> Welcome to DriveWise! This game will serve to help you improve your memory <br>
while also helping you practice for your written driver's test. Once you exit this instructions <br>
page and click on the button that says "Game Time!" you will be lead to a page with a four-by-four <br>
array of blue squares. There you will click on a box and click on another box. If the second box <br>
does not match with the first then you will be prompted to try again and using your memory <br>
you should be able to find two that match. Once you match them, you will be prompted with two <br>
multiple choice questions pertaining to driver's ed. Depending on the amount of questions <br>
you get right, you will be given points that will be added to your total score. Have fun! <br>
